# Human-Computer Interaction
User-Centric Website Prototype in Figma

This project is a high-fidelity prototype developed for a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course. It focuses on creating a visually engaging and highly usable website interface for a chosen audience within the culinary industry. Our design prioritizes accessibility, user experience, and interactivity, all built using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

### Purpose
Develop a user-centric website prototype that enhances visual design and usability for our target audience in the culinary field. The prototype, which was built in Figma, aims to improve the browsing and recipe discovery experience by addressing both aesthetic and functional issues found in existing cooking platforms.

## üí° SWOT Analysis

- **Strengths**:
  - **Limited Ingredient Database**: Allows focused search results based on user-selected ingredients.
  - **Personalization**: Recipe recommendations based on ingredients available, cooking time, and recipe difficulty.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Competition**: Competes with established cooking and recipe platforms.
  - **Limited Recipe Database**: Expanding recipes is a future need.

- **Opportunities**:
  - **Feature Expansion**: Potential to include cooking classes, personalized recommendations.
  - **Partnerships**: Collaboration with supermarkets for ingredient provision.

- **Threats**:
  - **User Engagement**: Longer ingredient selection process may deter some users.
  - **Market Competition**: High competition from large platforms with extensive recipe options.

## üë• Usability Testing Process
To ensure the prototype‚Äôs effectiveness, we conducted usability tests with participants outside our development group. Each test session included:

- **Scripted Task Completion**: Participants completed a series of tasks to simulate real-world usage.
- **Think-Aloud Protocol**: Users were encouraged to verbalize their thoughts for insight into usability issues.
- **Recording and Feedback Collection**: All sessions were recorded for analysis, and participants signed informed consent forms.
